# Syncs IPool schedule with a Google calendar

Needs two files to run:
1. A Google service account credentials.json, containing the necessary data for [gtoken](https://github.com/googleapis/node-gtoken).
2. A config.json containing CALENDAR_ID (for the google calendar to get the events), as well as USERNAME and PASSWORD containing the IPool credentials.
